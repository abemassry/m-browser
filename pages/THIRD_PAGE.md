# Third page

This is the third page of the M Browser example.

[link to first page (README)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abemassry/m-browser/refs/heads/main/README.md)

This is an example of how a series of pages can be linked together in the M Browser.

Imagine a webring from days of yore.

A whole site could be made of these interconnected pages. With a source site listing all of the
links and at the bottom a link to the next site in the webring and a link back to the homepage of
the site and possibly a link to a page containing links to all of the sites.
