# The M Browser

## Overview

The web and the web browser had a lot of good ideas. Maybe we can take some of those good ideas
and combine it with the utility of the web that puts the power of the web back in the hands of the user.

## Features

- **Display Markdown**: Display markdown files by default.
- **JSON format**: Display Markdown and or wasm files if specified in a json file. (planned
  feature)
- **Display WASM**: Display wasm files in a canvas that renders by default. (planned feature)
- **Legacy Webpages**: Display legacy webpages in a container that runs a full system including a
  browser, through wasm, that renders to a canvas. (planned feature)
